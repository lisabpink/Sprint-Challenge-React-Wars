1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

    React JS is a javascript library that helps to break your webpage down into components. By doing this you are easily able to scale and duplicate multiple items on the page. ReactJS also utilizes a virtual DOM to mimic the actual DOM. This allows you to render components without actually making changes to the actual DOM.
